    While recent advancements in the capabilities and widespread accessibility
    of generative language models, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), have brought
    about various benefits by generating fluent human-like text, the task of
    distinguishing between human- and large language model (LLM) generated text
    has emerged as a crucial problem. These models can potentially deceive by
    generating artificial text that appears to be human-generated. This issue is
    particularly significant in domains such as law, education, and science,
    where ensuring the integrity of text is of the utmost importance. This
    survey provides an overview of the current approaches employed to
    differentiate between texts generated by humans and ChatGPT. We present an
    account of the different datasets constructed for detecting
    ChatGPT-generated text, the various methods utilized, what qualitative
    analyses into the characteristics of human versus ChatGPT-generated text
    have been performed, and finally, summarize our findings into general
    insights.

    The Shared Task for CLIN33 focuses on a relatively novel yet societally
    relevant task: the detection of text generated by Large Language Models
    (LLMs). We frame this detection task as a binary classification problem
    (LLM-generated or not), using test data from up to 6 different domains and
    text genres for both Dutch and English. Part of this test data was held out
    entirely from the contestants, including a ”mystery genre” which belonged to
    an unknown domain (later revealed to be columns). Four teams submitted 11
    runs with substantially different models and features. This paper gives an
    overview of our task setup and contains the evaluation and detailed
    descriptions of the participating systems. Notably, included in the winning
    systems are both deep learning models as well as more traditional machine
    learning models leveraging task-specific feature engineering.

    Beyond individual languages, multilingual natural language processing (NLP)
    research increasingly aims to develop models that perform well across
    languages generally. However, evaluating these systems on all the world's
    languages is practically infeasible. To attain generalizability,
    representative language sampling is essential. Previous work argues that
    generalizable multilingual evaluation sets should contain languages with
    diverse typological properties. However, 'typologically diverse' language
    samples have been found to vary considerably in this regard, and popular
    sampling methods are flawed and inconsistent. We present a language sampling
    framework for selecting highly typologically diverse languages given a
    sampling frame, informed by language typology. We compare sampling methods
    with a range of metrics and find that our systematic methods consistently
    retrieve more typologically diverse language selections than previous
    methods in NLP. Moreover, we provide evidence that this affects
    generalizability in multilingual model evaluation, emphasizing the
    importance of diverse language sampling in NLP evaluation.

  abstract: >-
    The NLP research community has devoted increased attention to languages
    beyond English, resulting in considerable improvements for multilingual NLP.
    However, these improvements only apply to a small subset of the world's
    languages. Aiming to extend this, an increasing number of papers aspires to
    enhance generalizable multilingual performance across languages. To this
    end, linguistic typology is commonly used to motivate language selection, on
    the basis that a broad typological sample ought to imply generalization
    across a broad range of languages. These selections are often described as
    being 'typologically diverse'. In this work, we systematically investigate
    NLP research that includes claims regarding 'typological diversity'. We find
    there are no set definitions or criteria for such claims. We introduce
    metrics to approximate the diversity of language selection along several
    axes and find that the results vary considerably across papers. Furthermore,
    we show that skewed language selection can lead to overestimated
    multilingual performance. We recommend future work to include an
    operationalization of 'typological diversity' that empirically justifies the
    diversity of language samples.

  abstract: >-
    In order to draw generalizable conclusions about the performance of
    multilingual models across languages, it is important to evaluate on a set
    of languages that captures linguistic diversity.Linguistic typology is
    increasingly used to justify language selection, inspired by language
    sampling in linguistics.However, justifications for `typological diversity'
    exhibit great variation, as there seems to be no set definition, methodology
    or consistent link to linguistic typology.In this work, we provide a
    systematic insight into how previous work in the ACL Anthology uses the term
    `typological diversity'.Our two main findings are: 1) what is meant by
    typologically diverse language selection is not consistent and 2) the actual
    typological diversity of the language sets in these papers varies greatly.We
    argue that, when making claims about `typological diversity', an
    operationalization of this should be included.A systematic approach that
    quantifies this claim, also with respect to the number of languages used,
    would be even better.

    Even though many recent semantic parsers are based on deep learning methods,
    we should not forget that rule-based alternatives might offer advantages
    over neural approaches with respect to transparency, portability, and
    explainability. Taking advantage of existing off-the-shelf Universal
    Dependency parsers, we present a method that maps a syntactic dependency
    tree to a formal meaning representation based on Discourse Representation
    Theory. Rather than using lambda calculus to manage variable bindings, our
    approach is novel in that it consists of using a series of graph
    transformations. The resulting UD semantic parser shows good performance for
    English, German, Italian and Dutch, with F-scores over 75%, outperforming a
    neural semantic parser for the lower-resourced languages. Unlike neural
    semantic parsers, our UD semantic parser does not hallucinate output, is
    relatively easy to port to other languages, and is completely transparent.

    Conversational search systems enable information retrieval via natural
    language interactions, with the goal of maximizing users' information gain
    over multiple dialogue turns. The increasing prevalence of conversational
    interfaces adopting this search paradigm challenges traditional information
    retrieval approaches, stressing the importance of better understanding the
    engineering process of developing these systems. We undertook a systematic
    literature review to investigate the links between theoretical studies and
    technical implementations of conversational search systems. Our review
    identifies real-world application scenarios, system architectures, and
    functional components. We consolidate our results by presenting a layered
    architecture framework and explaining the core functions of conversational
    search systems. Furthermore, we reflect on our findings in light of the
    rapid progress in large language models, discussing their capabilities,
    limitations, and directions for future research.

    This paper describes our system created for the SemEval 2022 Task 3:
    Presupposed Taxonomies - Evaluating Neural-network Semantics. This task is
    focused on correctly recognizing taxonomic word relations in English, French
    and Italian. We developed various datageneration techniques that expand the
    originally provided train set and show that all methods increase the
    performance of modelstrained on these expanded datasets. Our final system
    outperformed the baseline system from the task organizers by achieving an
    average macro F1 score of 79.6 on all languages, compared to the baseline's
    67.4.
