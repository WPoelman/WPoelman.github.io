This is a collection of some 'interesting' acronyms used in research that I've encountered or that people have send to me.
I've not read most of these papers, it's just about the acronyms and [backronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym).
Feel free to send me some samples, I'll decide if they are egregious enough to make the list (with credits of course).

A next step would be automatic collection of these, but that removes some of the fun of encountering them in the wild.
I'm leaving that be for now.
