title: 'Egregious Acronyms in Research'

This is a collection of some 'interesting' acronyms used in research that I've encountered or that people have sent me.
I've not read most of these papers, it's just about the acronyms and [backronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym).
Feel free to send me some samples, I'll decide if they are egregious enough to make the list (with credits of course).

A next step would be automatic collection of these, but that removes some of the fun of encountering them in the wild.
I'm leaving that be for now.
