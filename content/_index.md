# Wessel Poelman

I work at the [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html) as a PhD student in the [LAGoM](https://www.lagom.cs.kuleuven.be/) group of [Miryam de Lhoneux](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~miryam.delhoneux/).
My research focuses on multilingual natural language processing, in particular: incorporating under-used resources, evaluation and sampling.

Before coming to Belgium, I worked at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) in Germany for half a year as a research associate (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter).
Before that, I completed a master's in Information Science at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) and worked for about two years as a machine learning engineer at [Web-IQ](https://web-iq.com/).
You can find more details on my [[cv]](data/poelman_cv_en.pdf).

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating: `contact` "[apenstaartje](https://ivdnt.org/actueel/columns-artikelen/apenstaartjes/)" `wesselpoelman.nl`

I occasionally write [posts](/post) about (strange) things I find interesting.
[Here]({{< ref "/post/2024-02-06-egregious.md" >}}), for example, you can find a list of 'egregious' acronyms in research I've come across.
Let me know if you've encountered one yourself, I'll add it to the list if it's egregious enough.
